# ‚öôÔ∏è SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

## Project: Nova ‚Äî The Ambient Personal AI

### 1. System Overview
Nova is an intelligent voice-based assistant designed to function entirely offline, providing personalized interactions while maintaining full user privacy. The system captures audio input, processes it locally using machine learning models, generates context-aware responses, and delivers them as synthesized speech.

It represents a closed-loop AI system consisting of four core modules:
- Input Processing (Voice Capture & Speech Recognition)
- Reasoning Engine (Natural Language Understanding)
- Output Generation (Text-to-Speech)
- User Interface & Feedback (Visual and Log-based)

### 2. System Analysis
#### a. Functional Requirements
| Functionality           | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Voice input capture    | Records audio from the user through a microphone. |
| Speech recognition     | Converts spoken input into text locally.          |
| Natural language reasoning | Processes the transcribed text using an LLM for intent and response. |
| Speech synthesis       | Converts textual responses into audio output.     |
| Offline operation      | All modules execute on the local device, no internet required. |
| Logging                | Stores interaction history locally for transparency. |
